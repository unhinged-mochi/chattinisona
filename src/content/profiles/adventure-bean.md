# About Cucumber Collector

In the Chattini community, cucumbers are more than just vegetables - they're currency, status symbols, and precious treasures. Cucumber Collector has dedicated their entire existence to finding, cataloging, and hoarding every cucumber variant known to plushie-kind.

## Signature Moves

- **Cucumber Detection**: Can smell a fresh cucumber from 500 meters away
- **Perfect Preservation**: Keeps cucumbers fresh indefinitely through mysterious methods
- **Trading Expertise**: Knows the exact market value of every cucumber type
- **Vault Security**: Protects the cucumber collection with elaborate security systems

## Background

Cucumber Collector's obsession began innocently enough - they found a particularly perfect cucumber during a community event and decided to keep it. This single cucumber became two, then ten, then a hundred. Before long, the Collector had amassed the largest cucumber repository in Chattini history.

Their vault (location highly classified) contains every cucumber variety imaginable: regular cucumbers, English cucumbers, Persian cucumbers, pickled cucumbers, and even legendary Golden Cucumbers rumored to grant wishes. Fellow Chattini can borrow cucumbers from the collection, but they must sign a detailed contract and provide two references.

The Collector maintains detailed maps showing every cucumber spawn point across Raora's streams and community events, updating them obsessively after each new discovery.

## Personality

Cucumber Collector lives and breathes cucumbers. Their conversations inevitably circle back to cucumbers regardless of the original topic. They're generous with cucumber knowledge but protective of their actual stash - viewing each cucumber as both a friend and an investment.

Despite their single-minded focus, the Collector is beloved in the community for their passion and dedication. They've turned cucumber collecting into an art form, inspiring other Chattini to pursue their own niche interests.

## Fun Facts
