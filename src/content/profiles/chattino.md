# About Chattino

Chattino is the heart of Raora Panthera's fanbase - an adorable blue cat-like plushie mascot that represents the Chattini community. This legendary pioneer was the first to successfully pilot a jetpack, inspiring countless other Chattini to chase their dreams of flight.

## Background

Born from the collective joy and enthusiasm of Raora Panthera's fans, Chattino emerged as the flagship mascot of the Chattini community. What started as a simple blue plushie quickly evolved into a jetpack-obsessed character with dreams bigger than the sky itself. Despite Raora's firm stance against providing jetpacks, Chattino remains undeterred, continuing the noble quest to this very day.

## Personality

Chattino embodies persistence and optimism. Never discouraged by rejection, this legendary Chattini approaches every stream with renewed hope that today might finally be the day Raora says yes to jetpacks. Between jetpack requests, Chattino enjoys collecting cucumbers, nibbling on microphones, and leading the Chattini community in various adorable shenanigans.
