# About Sparkle Supreme

✨ EVERYTHING IS AMAZING AND NOTHING HURTS ✨

That's Sparkle Supreme's life philosophy, and they live it every single day. This effervescent bean radiates pure positive energy and an inexhaustible supply of sparkle emojis.

## Abilities

- **Hype Amplifier**: Can turn any announcement into a major event
- **Emoji Mastery**: Knows every emoji and uses them ALL
- **Party Planning**: Coordinates community events with military precision
- **Eternal Optimism**: Sees the bright side of literally everything

## Background

Sparkle Supreme joined the community during a particularly dark time and decided that what everyone needed was more sparkle in their lives. They were absolutely right. Through tireless enthusiasm and genuine care, they transformed the community's energy and created a culture of celebration.

## Personality

If energy drinks were a person, they'd be Sparkle Supreme. Always typing in all caps (but the good kind), always ready with a "YAAAAS" or a string of celebration emojis. But beneath the sparkles lies a genuinely thoughtful person who remembers everyone's special days and makes sure no achievement goes uncelebrated.

## Fun Facts

- Special talent: Can type 200 WPM while using maximum emojis
