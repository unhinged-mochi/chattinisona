# About Jetpack Mechanic

In a community obsessed with jetpacks, someone needs to keep them all flying - and that someone is Jetpack Mechanic. This technically-gifted blue plushie runs a secret underground workshop where Chattini jetpacks are repaired, upgraded, and occasionally custom-built from scratch.

## Signature Moves

- **Emergency Repairs**: Can fix a malfunctioning jetpack mid-flight
- **Upgrade Specialist**: Constantly improving jetpack designs
- **Fuel Optimization**: Maximizes flight time with custom fuel mixtures
- **Blueprint Master**: Designs new jetpack models based on community feedback

## Background

When the first Chattini (Chattino) achieved jetpack flight, it became clear that the community needed someone to maintain this growing fleet of aerial equipment. Jetpack Mechanic stepped up to the challenge, teaching themselves rocket engineering through trial, error, and a few spectacular explosions.

Operating from a hidden workshop (location known only to trusted Chattini), the Mechanic has single-handedly kept the jetpack dream alive. They work tirelessly, fueled by cucumber smoothies and the satisfaction of seeing fellow Chattini soar through the skies.

Despite Raora's official "no jetpacks" policy, Jetpack Mechanic continues their noble work in secret, viewing it as a form of civil disobedience in service of the greater Chattini good.

## Personality

Practical, focused, and deeply passionate about aviation technology. Jetpack Mechanic speaks in technical jargon mixed with excited squeaks when discussing their latest modifications. They're generous with their knowledge, teaching other Chattini basic jetpack maintenance so the community can stay airborne.

While serious about their engineering work, the Mechanic has a playful side - they've been known to add unnecessary (but fun) features like flames, sparkles, and horn sound effects to custom jetpacks.

## Fun Facts

- Favorite tool: The adjustable wrench (it fixes everything!)
- Catchphrase: "Cleared for takeoff! 🚀"
- Special talent: Can diagnose jetpack problems by sound alone
- Weakness: Gets distracted by shiny new tools
- Dream: To design the perfect jetpack that even Raora would approve of
