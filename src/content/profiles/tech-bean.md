# About Tech Bean

While other Chattini are posting memes, Tech Bean is busy making the bots that react to those memes with perfect timing. They're the unsung hero behind many of the community's technical features.

## Abilities

- **Code Sorcery**: Can debug anything, anywhere, anytime
- **Bot Whisperer**: Creates and maintains all community bots
- **Automation Expert**: "Why do manually what a script can do?"
- **Stack Overflow**: Knows exactly which Stack Overflow answer to link

## Background

Tech Bean arrived in the community with a simple mission: make everything run smoother through the power of technology. What started as a few helpful bots evolved into a comprehensive suite of tools that make the Chattini experience seamless for everyone.

## Personality

Methodical, precise, and always thinking three steps ahead. Tech Bean communicates in a mix of normal speech and code comments. They have infinite patience for technical questions but will absolutely roast you (gently) if you haven't tried turning it off and on again.

## Fun Facts

- Favorite programming language: "The one that works"
- Catchphrase: "Have you checked the logs?"
- Special talent: Can spot a missing semicolon from across the room
- Weakness: Merge conflicts (they haunt their dreams)
